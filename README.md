# Project-1-Team-2

## Outline

We want to examine the Automotive and Technology Sectors to see which stock is the best to invest in.
For Automotive we are looking at Tesla, General Motors, and Ford.
For Technology we are looking at Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.

In order to get the information/data we need to achieve this, we most first create a CSV file with Google Finance to determine the close price for each individual stock.

### Actions needed to achieve desired outcome

1. Create the ipynb file that we are going to use for this project
2. Import the libraries we are going to use to achieve the desired outcome
3. Import the CSV files and put each individual stock into a table showing the date and close price
4. Then merge all stocks from each sector into one table so that it can be compared
5. Take the data and plot it to see the variance of price over the year 2022
6. Use quarterly statement function to figure out the earnings per share(eps)
7. Plot on a bar graph to see the differences in earnings per share of each stock
8. Import the S&P 500 to determine volatility and return on investment using Sharpe Ratio
